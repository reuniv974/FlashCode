--> Task 1
Previously, you typed your name as a string, but didn't save it.
Variables allow you to save data for use later. Let's call your name
||myName||. Try setting the variable to your name by typing ||myName = "Name"||.
Then, print your variable by passing it to the ||print()|| function, as in
||print(variable)||.
--> Input
r"print.*myName.*"
--> Output
r"\w+"

--> Task 2
Now your name, as a string, is stored in the variable ||myName||. Make
sure by typing ||myName||.
--> Input
r"myName"
--> Output
r"'\w+'"

--> Task 3
Now you know how to set variables. Set a variable called ||lastName||
to your last name. Print it.
--> Input
r"print\(lastName\)"
--> Output
r"\w+"

--> Task 4
||lastName|| is a variable, but the string ||"Name"|| is a literal. You can
treat variables the same way you treat literals. In module 1 you found the
length of your name, the string. Find the length of your ||lastName||, 
the variable.
--> Input
r"len\(lastName\)"
--> Output
r"\d+"

--> Task 5
Keep in mind, a variable's case matters. ||myName|| and ||MyName|| are not the
same variable. Try creating a variable ||fullName|| using ||myName|| and ||lastName||.
Then, print ||fullName||.
Hint: You can add (using ||+||) strings to concatenate, or merge, them.
--> Input
r"print\(fullName\)"
--> Output
r".*"
